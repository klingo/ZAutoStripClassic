## Description

Immediately strip all of your gear the second you leave combat!
Only truly works for hunters and rogues.

This addon was extracted from ZHunterMod (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/zhunter-mod) so rogues could benefit from it when they vanish during a boss wipe. Since you almost immediately get put back into combat after vanish, this addon will try to strip your gear before you are re-engaged.

Use: You can either use the /slash command below to auto strip the next time you leave combat or you can display the button for quick and easy use.

**/Slash Commands:** <br/>
``/zautostrip`` - Toggle the auto-strip function for the next time you leave combat. <br/>
``/zautostrip display`` - Displays the auto-strip button for easy use.

AutoStrip Button:
Hold ALT and LeftClick drag to move the button.
LeftClick to immediately strip your gear manually.
RightClick to enable the autocast for the next time you leave combat.
